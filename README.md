# seed_project_final
SEED Project was a term project for the Computing and Theory Application course I took in my Fall 2019 semester in Touro College. 
I created a website for a summer educational program in Buffalo Grove, IL. Written in HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript the website shares the SEED program's goal, media and important information.
