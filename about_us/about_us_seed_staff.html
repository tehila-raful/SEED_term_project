        <p class="staff_bios">Exuding positivity and good cheer Zehnny is always up for a good challenge.
        With years of camping experience, Zehnny was an integral staff member in camps Nageela Midwest, Nageela Orlando
        and most recently Agudah Midwest. Not only a staff member in camp but in school as well,
        Zehnny has been Torah Academy’s Sunday School permanent substitute for quite some time and is looking
        forward to teaching 5th and 6th grade Judaic studies in Torah Academy this year.</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p class="staff_bios">With a lively personality and an award winning smile, Tamar is everyone's best friend.
        A native Torontonian, she is a proud staff member of Camp Agudah Toronto, this year in the capacity of sports head.
        Tamar is the co-owner of Ahavah Dance Studio, a by-women for-women company that holds dance classes for all ages as well as a DJ special for bat mitzvahs.
        Buffalo Grove is excited to welcome Tamar to their Project Seed summer team!</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p class="staff_bios">Rachel's positivity is like a halo around her head, with an air of confidence she relates to each person and makes them feel comfortable.
        Reliable and driven to do what’s right, Rachel is a trend setter. Originally from New York City, Rachel calls Queens home,
        but she is no stranger to the Midwest having been on staff at Camp Nageela Midwest this summer.
        With all the campers and staff she knows, you are bound to have mutual friends!
        Buffalo Grove is excited to welcome Rachel to their Project Seed summer team!</p>

        Playing a lead role in her Israel program’s musical, Tehila didn't leave a dry eye in the house!
